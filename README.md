# Py-Pong
Simple game of pong created using Python; still somewhat new to Python so the code is fairly simple, not using any OOP yet:)

It's a two player game, with the left paddle being controlled by the {w, a, s, d} keys on the keyboard and the right paddle being controlled by the arrow-pad. The game runs pretty much as expected!

Main issue faced:
The horizontal speed of the pong ball increases and decreases unexpectedly. I could not figure out the reason why; the ball moves by pixel increments, and the x increments are never changed in the actual code. I'm not sure where this bug is coming from, BUT it does make the game a little more fun! :)
